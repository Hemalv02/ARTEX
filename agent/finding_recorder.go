For non-HTTP findings (e.g. TCP), when no capture is available, or when there is no exact match, omit the field or pass []; in evidence, retain other verifiable evidence such as command output and logs, and ideally explain why binding was skipped. Do not guess IDs, and do not re-probe just to fill in packets."
