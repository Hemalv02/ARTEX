//
// This function once passed the per-tick request budget
// (notifyMaxSendsPerChannelPerTick, derived backwards from the lease) straight

// result was that a channel with rate_per_min=20 refilled only 1 token in a
// 3-second tick, so each digest message held only 1 finding — digest degenerated
// into "real-time push with digest wording", and readers received a stream of
// "1 new finding in the last 30 minutes", while db.MaxDigestBatchSize was never
// reachable.
